## 1. Introduction
The *Last Stand: Defenders* mechanics are designed to create an engaging and strategic gameplay experience centered around resource management, defense building, and battling waves of zombies. This document outlines the mechanics involved in core gameplay, resource systems, combat, multiplayer, and monetization.

## 2. Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 2.1 Build Phase
- **Time-Limited Preparation:** Each wave begins with a Build Phase, where players have limited time (e.g., 2-3 minutes) to place defenses, reinforce barricades, and upgrade towers.
- **Resource Allocation:** Players use resources (wood, metal, electronics, ammo) to build and upgrade defenses, placing barricades and towers to shape zombie paths.
- **Slider Adjustments:** Players can adjust resource priority sliders at the beginning of the Build Phase to ensure gathering reflects their current needs.

### 2.2 Wave Phase
- **Zombie Waves:** Zombies spawn from predetermined points and follow paths created by the player’s barricades and obstacles. Waves progressively increase in difficulty.
- **Dynamic Pathing:** Zombies dynamically adjust their paths based on barricade placements, choosing the shortest accessible route or climbing obstacles if no path is available.
- **Zombie Abilities:** Certain zombies possess special abilities, such as summoning reinforcements, charging barricades, or emitting poison effects, adding depth to wave strategy.

### 2.3 Reward Phase
- **Post-Wave Rewards:** Players are given resources or currency after each wave. Every few waves, players also access the card draw mechanic.
- **Resource Collection:** Resource totals are updated, adding gathered resources based on player-adjusted priority sliders.

## 3. Resource Management Mechanics

### 3.1 Resource Priority System
- **Four Resource Types:** Wood, metal, electronics, and ammo. Each resource serves specific functions:
  - *Wood* - Used for barricade repairs and reinforcements.
  - *Metal* - Used for building barricades, traps, and other new structures.
  - *Electronics* - Used to upgrade towers and enable special features.
  - *Ammo* - Required to reload towers in Normal and Hard modes.
- **Slider Adjustment:** Players can adjust sliders to set the percentage of resources gathered. For example, setting electronics to 40% will focus gathering efforts there, balancing with the other resources.

### 3.2 Currency System
- **Basic Coins:** Earned by completing waves, used to purchase standard upgrades and boosters.
- **Gems (Premium Currency):** Purchased or earned in small amounts, used for premium upgrades, rare items, or additional card draws.
  
### 3.3 Upgrade Mechanics
- **Temporary Upgrades:** Boosts (e.g., increased tower range or damage) available for a limited number of waves.
- **Permanent Upgrades:** Rare upgrades offering lasting effects (e.g., +10% durability to all barricades). Usually earned through rare card draws or with premium currency.

## 4. Defense & Combat Mechanics

### 4.1 Barricade & Obstacle Placement
- **Strategic Placement:** Barricades can be placed to create a maze for zombies, forcing them to take longer paths and come under fire for longer durations.
- **Climbing Mechanic:** If a barricade fully blocks a path, zombies may climb over it, damaging it in the process. If barricades force a specific path, zombies take it unless blocked.
- **Durability System:** Barricades have health points and degrade over time as zombies attack or climb over them. Wood and metal are used for repairs.

### 4.2 Tower Mechanics
- **Tower Types:** Various tower types offer specific benefits:
  - *Basic Towers* - All-purpose defense with moderate damage and range.
  - *Sniper Towers* - High-damage, long-range towers for single targets.
  - *Support Towers* - Provide area-of-effect damage or debuffs, slowing down zombies or enhancing nearby towers.
- **Ammo & Reloading (Normal/Hard Modes):** Towers use ammo; players must spend resources to reload towers in between waves.
- **Upgrade Paths:** Towers can be upgraded to increase damage, rate of fire, or add effects like splash damage or freezing. 

### 4.3 Zombie Pathfinding & AI
- **Pathfinding Logic:** Zombies evaluate paths based on barricade placement, choosing the shortest accessible route unless fully blocked.
- **Zombie Types:** Includes basic zombies and special zombies with unique abilities:
  - *Tank Zombies:* High health, slow speed, resistant to knockback.
  - *Summoners:* Spawn additional zombies if not killed quickly.
  - *Screamers:* Emit an area effect that disables towers temporarily.

## 5. Multiplayer Mechanics

### 5.1 Fixed Rounds Scoring
- **Score-Based Competition:** Players are scored based on:
  - *Zombie Kills:* Each kill earns points, with tougher zombies yielding more.
  - *Defense Integrity:* Points awarded based on remaining health of barricades and towers.
  - *Resource Efficiency:* Extra points for using fewer resources.
- **Match Duration:** Lasts for a set number of waves (e.g., 10 waves). The player with the highest score wins.

### 5.2 Sudden Death Mode
- **Endurance-Based Competition:** Players survive as long as possible, with wave difficulty progressively increasing until one player’s base is breached.
- **Stamina Mechanics:** Players focus on long-term resource management and repair efficiency to outlast their opponent.

### 5.3 Leaderboards & Ranking
- **Global Leaderboards:** Based on competitive scores in multiplayer matches.
- **Ranking System:** Players earn points for wins and rank up to unlock special seasonal rewards.

## 6. Reward & Progression Mechanics

### 6.1 Card Reward System
- **Post-Level Card Selection:** Players pick from six face-down cards, receiving resources or temporary/permanent upgrades.
- **Ad-Based Second Draw:** Players can watch an ad to select a second card, gaining a potential extra bonus.
- **Rarity System:** Cards have different rarity levels, with higher-value resources and permanent upgrades being rarer.

### 6.2 Daily & Streak Rewards
- **Daily Rewards:** Players receive resources, currency, or boosters every day, with increased bonuses for premium players.
- **Weekly Streaks:** Extra rewards granted for logging in consecutively, including larger quantities of resources or rare items for premium players.

---

## 7. Monetization Mechanics

### 7.1 Ad Rewards
- **Optional Reward Ads:** Players can watch ads to gain additional resources or currency.
- **Interstitial Ads:** Ads shown at set points, such as after completing a level or every 10 waves, to generate revenue without disrupting gameplay.

### 7.2 Premium Currency Usage
- **Purchasable Gems:** Premium currency used for rare items, special upgrades, or card pack purchases.
- **Exclusive Upgrades for Premium Currency:** Certain high-value items or permanent upgrades are available only with Gems, giving paying players unique advantages without impacting free player progression.
